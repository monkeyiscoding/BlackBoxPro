## ðŸ“§ Option 3: Mailto Fallback (Already Working)

5. Check your email at `qphixindia@gmail.com` for the inquiry

## ðŸŽ¨ What's Already Included

Your contact form includes:
- Beautiful success dialog with "Thank You!" message
- Form validation (all fields required, mobile must be 10 digits)
- Loading spinner during submission
- Automatic form reset after successful submission
- Professional email formatting with all customer details
- Mobile-responsive design that matches your website

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### EmailJS Not Working?
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key are correct
- Make sure your EmailJS service is properly connected and verified

### Formspree Not Working?
- Check that your Form ID is correct
- Verify your Formspree form is active and verified

### General Issues?
- Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for errors
- Make sure you're testing on a web server (not just opening the HTML file directly)

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you need help with the setup, the form is already working perfectly - you just need to choose and configure one of the email services above. The fallback mailto method will work immediately without any setup!
